            <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">Welcome! This is an offline-capable Notepad which is a Progressive Web App.

The app serves the following features:

- Your notes are saved in real-time as you type.
- Installable on supported browsers for offline usage.
- "Add To Home Screen" feature on Android-supported devices to launch the app from the home screen.
- Dark mode.
- Privacy-focused - Never collects your precious data.
- Light-weight - Loads almost instantly.
- Writing timer.
- View Note Statistics.
- Ability to mimic typewriter sound when typing.
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions.
- Focus mode to leave you with a barebones and pristine editor.
- Full-screen mode for a distraction-free writing experience.
- Floating window (in supported browsers) to effectively take notes across other apps.
- Download notes as plain text, PDF, HTML, and DOCX file.
- Ability to play ambient noise to help you focus.
- It's proudly open-source!

CAUTION: Since the app uses the browser's localStorage to store your notes, 
it's recommended that you take a backup of your notes more often using the 
"Download Notes" button or by pressing the "Ctrl/Cmd + S" keys.

Lastly, if you're using Notepad, and want to support the development, 
you can buy me a coffee — the link of which is available in the About section.
